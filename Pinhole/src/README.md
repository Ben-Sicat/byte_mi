Okay what's up bitches... I'll discuss here how I plan on creating the `volume estimation` of the system
# Volume Estimation System Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Volume Estimation System, with a particular focus on the camera calibration module. The system is designed to estimate the volume of food items using advanced image processing techniques and deep learning models.

## System Architecture

### Camera Calibration Module

The camera calibration module, located in the `camera_calibration` directory, is a critical component ensuring the accuracy of our volume estimation process. The primary file in this module is `calibrate_cam.py`, which contains the essential `CameraCalibrate` class.

#### `CameraCalibrate` Class

The `CameraCalibrate` class is responsible for performing robust and flexible camera calibration. It includes the following key methods:

1. `CameraCalibrate.calibrate()`
   - Purpose: Executes the camera calibration process using a plate mask.
   - Input: Utilizes the plate mask derived from the Mask R-CNN model output.
   - Process: Employs the corners of the plate in conjunction with known plate dimensions to establish a precise relationship between real-world measurements and pixel values.

2. `CameraCalibrate._sort_corners()`
   - Purpose: Auxiliary method ensuring consistent ordering of plate corners.
   - Process: Implements an algorithm to sort corner points in a specific order, enhancing the reliability of subsequent calculations.

3. `CameraCalibrate.project_3d_to_2d()`
   - Purpose: Projects 3D points onto the 2D image plane.
   - Input: 3D coordinates in world space.
   - Output: Corresponding 2D coordinates in image space.

4. `CameraCalibrate.unproject_2d_to_3d()`
   - Purpose: Reprojects 2D image points back into 3D space.
   - Input: 2D coordinates in image space.
   - Output: Corresponding 3D coordinates in world space.

## Future Developments

The system is under active development. Upcoming features and modules will be documented in this section as they are implemented, including:

- Integration with the Mask R-CNN model for precise food item segmentation.
- Implementation of advanced volume calculation algorithms.
- Development of a user interface for system interaction and result visualization.

## Conclusion

This README will be regularly updated to reflect the current state and capabilities of the Volume Estimation System. For inquiries, contributions, or further information, please contact the project maintainers through the appropriate channels.
